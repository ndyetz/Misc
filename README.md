# Misc
Miscellaneous code that I have. Sometimes it is just me trying something new. I like to help people incorporate R into their work. Instance where I create lessons for people or I provide from statistical consultation for individual will be put in this repository. If I find that consultation becomes a regular thing for me, I will create a separate repository for that. In the mean time... MISC!
